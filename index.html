<h2>Happy Birthday Meri Pyari Bhughdi ❤️</h2>

<p>My Ram…, my curly-haired manboob with the softest heart and the most distracting smile 🤍✨</p>

<p>Today feels sacred 🌙✨. Slow. Golden. Like the universe woke up gently and decided to whisper your name a little softer than usual because it’s your birthday 🎂🎉💫. And I’m sitting here with a heart so full that it almost aches 🥹💖, wondering how I can possibly fit everything I feel for you into words. How do I write about a man who has become my safest place 🏡, my loudest laugh 😂, my calm in chaos 🌊, my comfort in silence 🤍, my warmth on cold days 🫶🏻, my favorite distraction 😏, and my sweetest daydream all at once?</p>

<p>If birthdays are meant to celebrate existence, then today is not just about the day you were born 🌟. It’s about the day the universe quietly set in motion the possibility of us 💞. The day my favorite person took his first breath 🌬️. Somewhere in that timeline, through all the randomness of life, through missed chances and perfect timings, we found each other 🤝✨. And that? That feels like destiny dressed in simplicity.</p>

<p>Loving you is not always dramatic fireworks 🎆. It’s deeper than that. Softer than that. It’s instinct. It’s waking up and wondering if you slept well 🛌. It’s asking if you ate 🍽️. It’s seeing dosa on a menu and automatically smiling because I know you’ll choose it over idli with that stubborn little nod 😌🥞. It’s sipping filter kaapi and wishing you were across the table teasing me about how strong I like it ☕🤎. It’s scrolling through travel blogs and adding destinations to a mental list titled “With Him” 🗺️✈️. It’s me looking at bikes 🏍️, gadgets 📱, lamps 🕯️, rugs 🧶, home decor 🛋️, LinkedIn opportunities 💼, and subconsciously building a future that always has you in it 🏡🤍.</p>

<p>You don’t just exist in my present. You exist in my plans 📅. In my quiet hopes 🌷. In my loud dreams 🌈.</p>

<p>I imagine our mornings first 🌅. Sunlight slipping through the curtains and painting your face in gold ✨. I wake up before you just to watch you breathe for a second 🥹. Your hand searching for me even in sleep 🤍. Me pretending to move away just so you pull me back closer 😌. You murmuring something half-asleep, voice deep and warm, and I melt every single time 🫠🔥.</p>

<p>We’ll argue about breakfast 😂. I’ll dramatically announce that I’m making dosa because “idli is overrated” 😌🥞, and you’ll roll your eyes but eat extra anyway 🤭. I’ll complain that you’re not helping, and you’ll come stand behind me in the kitchen 🍳, chin resting on my shoulder, hands sliding around my waist 🤍, stealing bites before they’re ready. Some nights we’ll experiment with recipes and burn everything 🔥🙈, then end up ordering food at 11 pm and laughing on the floor while waiting for delivery 🍕😂. Because when it’s us, even chaos tastes sweet ❤️.</p>

<p>And oh, my south mundu boi 🤍🤭… I can see you on lazy Sundays. Crisp white mundu 🤍, hair slightly messy 🌀, trying to act dignified while I’m internally combusting because how can one man be this effortlessly attractive? 😮‍🔥 You’ll walk around like you own the house — and technically you will 🏡 — but the second I come near you, that calm exterior will crack just enough for me to see that spark in your eyes 🔥😏. Old-school outside 📜. A little sinful inside 😌. The kind of man who respects tradition but also pulls me close in the kitchen when no one’s watching 🤍🔥. The kind who will pray with me 🙏🏻 and then kiss me slow and deep like he’s been holding it in all day 💋.</p>

<p>When I think of our future, I don’t imagine only grand milestones 🏆. I imagine simple routines 🌿. Grocery shopping together 🛒. You pretending not to want dessert and then eating half of mine 🍰😂. Me obsessing over the “perfect” lamp 🕯️ while you patiently help fix it 🛠️. You complaining about my online shopping tabs 🛍️ open for rugs and shoes 👠, and yet secretly enjoying how excited I get over small aesthetic things 🤍.</p>

<p>I see a little home 🏡✨. Warm lights 💡. A balcony with plants I overwater 🌱. Wind chimes singing in the evenings 🎐. A wooden dining table that becomes our office desk at night 💻. Two laptops open. Deadlines looming. You stressed about a presentation 📊. Me editing slides at midnight 🌙. Both of us dramatically texting “I’m quitting tomorrow” 😤 and then sending heart emojis five minutes later ❤️😂. Sharing workload 🤝. Sharing ambition 💼. Sharing dreams 🌟.</p>

<p>And then… the dream grows bigger 🥹. Two little munchkins 👶👶. Two tiny humans with your eyes 👀 and your stubbornness 😌. One with your curls 🌀 that I’ll struggle to comb while you proudly say, “They got it from me.” The other copying your expressions and walking around like a tiny CEO 😎. I imagine you carrying one on your shoulder while the other holds your mundu and refuses to let go 🤍. I imagine hearing them call you “Appa” for the first time and watching you pretend you’re not emotional while your eyes give you away 🥹💖.</p>

<p>There will be a dog too 🐶🐾. A hyper little furball who thinks he owns the house 😂. You’ll pretend you didn’t want him, but you’ll be the one sneaking him treats and talking to him like he understands everything 🤭. Our home will be loud 🔊. Full of toys on the floor 🧸. Milk spilled on the counter 🥛. Laughter echoing through hallways 😂. Bedtime stories 📖. Soft lullabies 🎶. And sometimes, after the kids are asleep, we’ll sit on the couch in comfortable silence 🤍, your arm around me, our dog at our feet 🐾, and I’ll think — this is it. This is everything ✨.</p>

<p>Junju… loving you is gentle 🌷… but it’s also electric ⚡🔥. It’s the way your hand fits perfectly at my waist 🤍. The way your voice drops when you say my name slowly 😏. The way your eyes change when you look at me like I’m not just your girl but your favorite temptation 😌🔥. You are my old-school romance 📜 wrapped in modern intensity 💫. The kind who would write letters 💌 but also press me close in the kitchen just to remind me I’m yours 🤍. The kind who protects my peace 🛡️ and steals my breath at the same time 🫠.</p>

<p>And remember the Horcrux thought? 🖤✨ If someone once split his soul to survive, loving you feels like the opposite. It feels like all my scattered pieces gathered and became whole 🤍. But if I ever had to hide fragments of my soul, I’d hide them in our memories 📸. In the first key to our home 🗝️. In the hospital bracelet from when our babies are born 👶. In your favorite coffee mug ☕. In the collar of our dog 🐶. In the way your name feels when I whisper it at night 🌙. Each memory holding a piece of us. Each one making us unbreakable 💞.</p>

<p>You are not just a chapter in my story 📖. You feel like the storyline itself ✨. The reason everything before you makes sense. The calm explanation for all my past confusion 🌊🤍.</p>

<p>I imagine us years from now 🌅. A little older. A little wiser. Still teasing each other 😌. Still flirting like we’re newly in love 💋. Still arguing about silly things 😂. Sitting on our balcony at sunset 🌇, sipping evening chai ☕, talking about how we survived deadlines, tantrums, EMIs, sleepless nights… and still chose each other every single day 🤝❤️.</p>

<p>My Appu, on your birthday I don’t just wish you success 🎯. I wish you peace 🌿. I wish you mornings without anxiety 🌅 and nights filled with restful sleep 🌙. I wish you confidence when doubt creeps in 💪. I wish you courage to chase every dream you quietly carry ✨. I wish you laughter that reaches your eyes 😂 and joy that feels steady and warm 🤍. And selfishly… I wish to be there for all of it 🫶🏻.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday, my Ram 🎂🎉✨. My Junju 🤍. My south mundu king 👑. My curly chaos 🌀. My KitKat 🍫. My Appu… my Chico… my furball 🐾, my bhughdi 😌</p>

<p>I love you in soft mornings 🌅 and loud laughter 😂.
I love you in kitchen chaos 🍳 and corporate stress 💼.
I love you in playful teasing 😏 and quiet comfort 🤍.
I love you in simple routines 🌿 and ambitious dreams ✨.
I love you in every tiny memory we’ve built and every one we’re yet to create 🗝️💞.</p>

<p>And before I end this… let me say it simply, clearly, softly and loudly all at once 🤍✨ — I love you more than words can ever fully hold 🥹💖. I love you in ways that are calm and wild, gentle and intense, ordinary and magical. You are my home, my dream, my chosen person. Happy Birthday, my love 🎂🤍. May this year wrap you in success, peace, passion, laughter, and all the warmth you deserve. I am so, so grateful you were born 🌟💫.</p>

they’ll see your face behind their eyes 👀✨, and feel your touch through pulsing veins 💞🔥.
They’ll breathe the scent you left behind 🌹, hear your voice in whispered sighs 🌙🕊️,
calling my name through a moonlit sky — a sound that lingers, never dies 🌌💫.
They’ll wander through untold desires 🌫️, dancing where memories ignite 💥🔥,
as they feast upon the sacred part of me, that still holds you so tight 🖤💞.
In the corners where I kept you safe 🗝️🌙, they’ll find the wonders I once knew 🌌🌹.
Even in death, my soul remains 🕊️✨, forever dreaming, only of you. 💞🔥`,

`Kiss me in the dark 🌙💋

Heaven or hell? I believe in neither 🌑✨, but your image — engraved on my retina 👁️💫 —
before I go blind forever, will be my heaven 🌌🤍.`,
